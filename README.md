# Local Events Explorer

An application that displays local events, workshops, and festivals based on a user's location, allowing them to explore and join activities.

This repository contains the Stage 1 (HTML & CSS), Stage 2 (Canvas API) and Stage 3 (Audio API) implementation.

Features implemented:
- Responsive HTML/CSS layout with event cards and controls
- Canvas visualization of nearby events relative to user's location
- Sample event dataset and geolocation-based filtering
- Audio API support: per-event audio previews (Web Audio API), volume control, visualization, and SpeechSynthesis fallback

How to run
1. Open `main.html` in your browser (double-click or use a local server).
2. Allow location access or enter location coordinates when prompted.
3. Click an event's "Preview" button or use the audio controls to play audio. If your browser blocks audio, interact (click) to enable the AudioContext.
